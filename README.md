# PMM-Config

I wanted to be able to easily see on Plex if a show has been downloaded in full or if there are missing episodes or seasons. After searching around for days for something that can do it I finally asked for some help from the guys on the PMM Discord group and they confirmed that PMM would not be able to do it but that I'd be able to do it using a few API's to add labels to Plex and then use PMM to add overlays using those labels.
